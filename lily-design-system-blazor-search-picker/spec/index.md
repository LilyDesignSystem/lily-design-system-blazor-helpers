# SearchPicker — Specification

Single source of truth for the `lily-design-system-blazor-search-picker`
Blazor helper. This file drives implementation, testing, and
documentation: anything not in this spec is out of scope; anything in
this spec must be exercised by a test.

This package is a port of the canonical Svelte helper
[`@lilydesignsystem/svelte-search-picker`](../../../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/lily-design-system-svelte-search-picker/spec/index.md).
Per [`AGENTS/helpers.md`](../../../AGENTS/helpers.md), Svelte is
canonical: the behaviour contract below is the Svelte contract, and the
§7 clause numbering is deliberately identical so the two suites can be
read side by side. Where Blazor forces a difference it is called out in
§9 rather than quietly absorbed.

Sibling files:

- `SearchPicker.razor` — Razor markup
- `SearchPicker.razor.cs` — C# code-behind (partial class)
- `SearchPickerTests.cs` — bUnit + xUnit spec exercising every clause in §7
- `index.md` — user-facing guide
- `docs/accessibility.md` — tradeoffs, stated plainly

---

## 1. Goal

Give a Blazor 10 application a drop-in, headless site-search control that:

1. Renders a single-icon button (a bundled magnifying-glass SVG) matching
   the other Lily page-header helpers.
2. Opens a dropdown holding a search text field and, at its right, a
   submit button whose visible label is `⏎` (U+23CE RETURN SYMBOL).
3. On Return in the field, or on activating the submit button, performs
   a GET navigation to `/?<query>` — searching for `foo` goes to `/?foo`.
4. Ships zero CSS and zero JS files.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Running the search.** The control only navigates; the page at
  `/?<query>` (or a custom `Action`) does the searching.
- **Suggestions, autocomplete, or a results list.** This is a field and a
  submit button, not a combobox.
- **Persistence.** There is no preference to remember. Nothing is written
  to `localStorage`.
- **A named query parameter.** The contract is the bare query string
  (`/?foo`), not `/?q=foo`; see §3.
- **Shipping a JS file.** The one browser question the component asks is
  reached through `IJSRuntime` `eval` from an event handler.

## 3. Architectural decisions

- **A helper that owns an action, like `share-picker`.** It applies
  nothing to the document and persists nothing; it is a helper because it
  owns a complete interaction end to end and ships the same headless
  contract. See `AGENTS/helpers.md`.
- **A disclosure holding a real `<form role="search">`, not a menu.** The
  popup is a native form: a `type="search"` field and a `type="submit"`
  button, so Return-to-submit, mobile "search" keyboards and form
  semantics all come from the platform. The form is a search landmark,
  named by `Label`.
- **The bare query, so navigation is done in C#.** A native GET form
  submission always sends `name=value` pairs (`/?q=foo`). The contract is
  `/?foo`, so the form carries `@onsubmit:preventDefault` and the
  component navigates to `SearchHref(query, Action)` itself. The form
  keeps `action`/`method="get"` so its semantics stay truthful.
- **Encoded and trimmed, byte-for-byte like JavaScript.** The query is
  trimmed and passed through a C# equivalent of `encodeURIComponent`:
  `Uri.EscapeDataString` with `! ' ( ) *` put back, because
  `EscapeDataString` escapes those five and `encodeURIComponent` does
  not. `foo bar` goes to `/?foo%20bar` and `a&b` to `/?a%26b`, the same
  URL every Lily catalog builds. An empty or whitespace-only query
  navigates nowhere.
- **`Navigate` is overridable.** The default is
  `NavigationManager.NavigateTo(href, forceLoad: true)`, a real GET
  request — the Blazor equivalent of `location.assign`. An app that wants
  the search routed in-app passes its own `Navigate`.
- **`⏎` is the visible label, never the accessible name.** It renders in
  an `aria-hidden` span; the button's name is the required `SubmitLabel`,
  because a screen reader announcing "return symbol" names a key, not
  the action. Likewise `Label` and `InputLabel` are required with no
  English default — see `AGENTS/internationalization.md`.
- **The trigger composes headless `IconButton`.** A real dependency on
  `LilyDesignSystem.Blazor.Headless`, the same "depend on, don't vendor"
  rule share-picker follows. The panel is a form, not a listbox, so
  headless `Listbox` is the wrong widget for it.

| `OnSearch`             | `EventCallback<SearchEventArgs>`        | no       | —                                        | Fires with the trimmed query and destination, before navigating. |
| `ChildContent`         | `RenderFragment<SearchPickerContext>?`  | no       | the default SVG icon                     | Replaces the button icon.                                        |
| `CssClass`             | `string`                                | no       | `""`                                     | Extra class on the root.                                         |
| `AdditionalAttributes` | unmatched attributes                    | no       | —                                        | Spread onto the root `<div>`.                                    |

```csharp
public sealed class SearchPickerContext
{
    public required bool Open { get; init; }
    public required string Query { get; init; }
}

public sealed class SearchEventArgs
{
    public required string Query { get; init; }
    public required string Href { get; init; }
}
```

### 4.2 DOM contract

```html
<div class="search-picker {CssClass}" ...AdditionalAttributes>
  <button
    type="button"
    class="search-picker-button"
    aria-label="{Label}"
    aria-expanded
    aria-controls="{panelId}"
  >
    <svg class="search-picker-icon" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="1.05rem" height="1.05rem" aria-hidden="true" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.6" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="7" cy="7" r="4.5"/><path d="M10.5 10.5 14 14"/></svg>
  </button>
  <div class="search-picker-panel" id="{panelId}" hidden>
    <form class="search-picker-form" role="search" aria-label="{Label}" action="{Action}" method="get">
      <input class="search-picker-input" type="search" aria-label="{InputLabel}" placeholder="{Placeholder}" enterkeyhint="search" />
      <button type="submit" class="search-picker-submit" aria-label="{SubmitLabel}">
        <span class="search-picker-submit-symbol" aria-hidden="true">⏎</span>
      </button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

The submit button follows the field in DOM order, so it sits at the
field's right in left-to-right layouts (and at its left under
`dir="rtl"`). Its placement is consumer CSS. `placeholder` is omitted
entirely when `Placeholder` is `null`.

### 4.3 Public surface

Component `SearchPicker` in namespace `LilyDesignSystem.Blazor.Helpers`,
plus the types `SearchPickerContext` and `SearchEventArgs`.

Blazor has no module barrel, so the Svelte package's re-exports become
`public` static members:

| Svelte export               | Blazor equivalent                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `RETURN_SYMBOL`             | `SearchPicker.ReturnSymbol` (`const string`, `"⏎"`) |
| `searchHref(query, action)` | `SearchPicker.SearchHref(query, action = "/")`      |
| `nextSearchPickerId()`      | `SearchPicker.NextSearchPickerId()`                 |
| types `Props`, `ChildArgs`  | the parameters above; `SearchPickerContext`         |

Internal statics, visible to the test project: `EncodeUriComponent(value)`
`FocusLeftScript(panelId)`, and `ClickWaitMilliseconds`.

## 5. Behaviour

### 5.1 Searching

Return in the field or activating the submit button submits the form. The
native submission is cancelled (`@onsubmit:preventDefault`); the
component trims the query and — when it is non-empty — fires
`OnSearch(new SearchEventArgs { Query, Href })`, closes the panel, and
calls `Navigate(href)` (default `NavigationManager.NavigateTo(href,
forceLoad: true)`), where `href = SearchHref(query, Action)`. An empty or
whitespace-only query does nothing and leaves the panel open.

### 5.2 Keyboard

| Key               | On the icon button            | In the panel                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Opens (or closes) the panel   | In the field: `Enter` searches. On ⏎: searches. |
| `Escape`          | —                             | Closes and returns focus to the icon button     |
| `Tab`             | Moves on                      | Native order: field → ⏎ → out, which closes     |

Opening moves focus into the search field. Clicking outside, or focus
moving to an element outside the root, closes the panel without moving
focus. A focusout that is not a confirmed departure — Safari's click on
`⏎` or on the icon button (which blurs the field to `<body>` without
focusing the button), a window blur — does **not** close it, so the
click that caused it still lands. How Blazor tells these apart: §9. Every focus move the component makes on its own
passes `preventScroll: true`, and every one is deferred to
`OnAfterRenderAsync`: the field cannot take focus while the panel still
carries `hidden`.

## 6. Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AAA target. The icon is `aria-hidden`; the button's accessible
name is `Label`. The form is a search landmark (`role="search"`) named by
`Label`; the field is named by `InputLabel`; the submit button by
`SubmitLabel`, with `⏎` hidden from assistive technology. All three names
are consumer-supplied and localisable.

Known costs, stated rather than glossed: the trigger's name rests
entirely on `aria-label`, with no visible text fallback; and `⏎` as the
only visible submit label assumes the symbol is understood, which is why
the accessible name never relies on it. Full treatment in
[`docs/accessibility.md`](../docs/accessibility.md).

## 7. Testing acceptance criteria

`SearchPickerTests.cs` asserts every clause below. Clause numbering
matches the canonical Svelte spec one-for-one.

1. Renders a `<button class="search-picker-button">` named by `Label`, with `aria-expanded="false"` and `aria-controls` naming the panel.
2. The panel is hidden until the button is activated; activating opens it (`aria-expanded="true"`), activating again closes it.
3. The default icon is an `aria-hidden` SVG `.search-picker-icon`.
4. `ChildContent` replaces the icon and receives `SearchPickerContext` (`Open`, `Query`).
5. The panel holds a `<form role="search">` named by `Label`, a `type="search"` field named by `InputLabel`, and a `type="submit"` button named by `SubmitLabel` after the field.
6. The submit button's visible content is `⏎` in an `aria-hidden` span.
7. Opening focuses the search field with `preventScroll: true`.
8. Pressing Return in the field (submitting the form) navigates to `/?<query>`: `foo` → `/?foo`, and the native form submission is cancelled.
9. Clicking the submit button navigates the same way.
10. The query is trimmed and URI-encoded: `  foo bar ` → `/?foo%20bar`, `a&b` → `/?a%26b` — exactly as `encodeURIComponent` would (a second test pins `! ' ( ) *` and UTF-8).
11. An empty or whitespace-only query does not navigate and leaves the panel open.
12. `Action` changes the path: `Action="/search"` sends `foo` to `/search?foo`.
13. `OnSearch` fires with the trimmed query and the href, before `Navigate`.
14. Without `Navigate`, the default calls `NavigationManager.NavigateTo(href, forceLoad: true)` (canonical: `location.assign(href)`).
15. A search closes the panel.
16. `Escape` closes the panel and returns focus to the button with `preventScroll: true`.
17. Clicking outside closes the panel (decided by the focus-left script — §9).
18. Focus moving to an element outside the root closes the panel; focus moving between the root's own controls does not.
19. An initial `Value` pre-fills the field, and typing updates the bound `Value` (`ValueChanged`).
20. `SearchHref()` builds the same destination the component navigates to.
21. `ReturnSymbol` is the bare `⏎` (U+23CE).
22. `CssClass` is appended to `search-picker` on the root, and unmatched attributes spread onto the root.
23. The component renders no user-facing text of its own: with no `Placeholder` the field has none, and the only text node is the `aria-hidden` `⏎`.
24. A focusout that is not a confirmed departure (Safari's click on `⏎` or on the icon button, a window blur, an interop failure) leaves the panel open, so the click that caused it still lands: the icon button then toggles the panel closed, and `⏎` searches.

### 7.1 How focus is asserted

bUnit has no live focus model. `ElementReference.FocusAsync()` goes out
over JS interop as `Blazor._internal.domWrapper.focus`, carrying the
target's `ElementReference` and the `preventScroll` flag; bUnit stamps
every `@ref`'d element with a stable `blazor:elementReference` GUID in
the first render's markup, so the suite maps GUID → element once and
asserts exactly which element was focused, and how. Clauses 7 and 16
rest on this — the same mechanism `SharePickerTests` documents.

### 7.2 How navigation and the focus check are stubbed

bUnit registers a `FakeNavigationManager`, which records every
`NavigateTo` call (URI and `ForceLoad`) in `History` — clause 14. The
root's focusout asks the browser through `eval`; bUnit's Loose mode
returns `default(bool)` (`false`, "focus went outside") for an unmatched
call, and clause 18 stubs it `true` to model a move between the root's
own controls.

## 8. Verification

From `lily-design-system-blazor-helpers/tests/LilyDesignSystem.Blazor.Helpers.Tests`:

```sh
dotnet test
```

The whole catalog suite must be green. This package contributes 26
cases (24 clauses; clauses 10 and 24 split in two); the catalog total
is 332 (including PickerBar's two search-wiring cases).

## 9. Blazor deviations from the canonical Svelte implementation

Each of these is forced by the framework, not chosen.

- **No standing document-level click listener.** The Svelte version
  closes on an outside click via `<svelte:document onclick>`. This
  package ships no JS file and installs no permanent listener; an
  outside click is detected from the `focusout` it causes, by the
  focus-left script below. Clause 17 is asserted that way.
- **`FocusEventArgs` has no `relatedTarget`.** Blazor does not surface
  it, so the component cannot apply the canonical rule ("close only
  when `relatedTarget` is a known element outside the root; a null
  `relatedTarget` never closes") to the event itself. Unlike
  `SharePicker` — whose list items only move focus under the
  component's own control, so a suppress-next-focusout flag suffices —
  this panel has native Tab order between the field, `⏎`, and the
  trigger. So on `focusout` it asks the browser, through `eval`
  (`FocusLeftScript`), after a `setTimeout(0)` while focus settles:
  - the active element is a real element → "left" exactly when it is
    outside the root (clause 18; Tab between the root's own controls
    stays open);
  - the active element is `<body>` / none — the C# equivalent of a null
    `relatedTarget` (Safari's click on a button, a click on a
    non-focusable area) → not a departure by itself (clause 24). The
    script waits for the click that caused it (a one-shot capture
    listener, removed as soon as it fires) and answers "left" only if
    that click landed outside the root (clause 17). A click on the icon
    button lands inside, so the trigger's own click handler toggles the
    panel closed. No click within `ClickWaitMilliseconds` (5 s) — a
    window blur, say — answers "not left".

  Only a confirmed "left" closes; an interop failure keeps the panel
  open. Known residual: under `InteractiveServer` on a slow connection,
  a very fast outside click can fire before the script's listener is
  installed; the panel then stays open (never wrongly closes).
- **`⏎` keeps focus on mousedown.** The submit button carries
  `@onmousedown:preventDefault`, so pressing it with a pointer does not
  blur the field first. In a browser that does not focus buttons on
  click (Safari), that blur would otherwise send focus to `<body>`, close
  the panel, and the click would never land.
- **`Escape` may also clear the field.** The Svelte version calls
  `preventDefault()` on `Escape`. Blazor evaluates
  `@onkeydown:preventDefault` at render time, so it cannot be applied to
  one key — and applying it to every key would stop typing. Browsers
  whose `type="search"` field clears on `Escape` will therefore clear it
  (and report the empty value through `ValueChanged`) as the panel
  closes.
- **`navigate` is `Navigate`, an `Action<string>?`;** its default is
  `NavigationManager.NavigateTo(href, forceLoad: true)` rather than
  `location.assign(href)` — both a real GET.
- **`onSearch` carries a `SearchEventArgs`** rather than two positional
  arguments, because `EventCallback<T>` is single-argument.
- **`bind:value` is `@bind-Value`** (`Value` + `ValueChanged`).
- **`class` is `CssClass`.** `class` is a C# keyword.
- **`children` is `ChildContent`**, typed
  `RenderFragment<SearchPickerContext>` rather than a Svelte snippet.
- **An interactive render mode is required.** Under static SSR the
  markup renders, but no event handler runs, so the button cannot open
  the panel.
